  <p><em>“I didn’t even know I had a great job. I was just a kid!”</em> ― Paula Scher</p>
  
  <p><em>“I had moved to New York and no one even knew what graphic design was, it was just the 70s,”</em> ― Paula Scher</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1994 The Public Theatre, Shakespeare in the Park</h3>

<p>Scher took on the challenge of being the first designer to create a new distinct look for The Public Theatre, a program that became the turning point of identity and individuality in the design world. This program has been a major influence to theatre promotion projects and for cultural institutes all around the world.</p>

<p>Setting a new bar for typography in the 1990s, Scher’s graphic campaign for New York's Public Theater revolutionised its identity one poster after another.  In a report by ‘Making Music Modern’ Scher’s work was described as using “unorthodox spacing, mixing font colors and weights, and employing uncommon and often historic typefaces, Scher's text-heavy poster presents a large amount of information in a dynamic and expressive way.” - manualzz.com</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I just remember that everything looked the same-all style and no substance”</em> ― Paula Scher, Make It Bigger</p>
  
  <p>“<em>I love the big scale and immediate impact of posters. They're my favourite things to design.”</em> ― Paula Scher</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scher's identity for the Public Theater emphasises the word <em>"public"</em> mainly to showcase the institution as the affordable and accessible venue that it is.  In 1995, Scher in conjunction with Pentagram, designed a promotional campaign for the production of Savion Glover's <strong>Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk</strong> showing in the Public Theatre.</p>

<img src="img/funk-public.jpg"/>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>My work is play. And I play when I design. I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure that I actually do that, and the definition of 'play,' number one, was 'engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor,' and number two was 'gambling.' And I realize I do both when I'm designing.”</em> ― Paula Scher</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They featured the wood typefaces used throughout, two dimensional photographs and bold solid colors for the theater's posters and billboards displayed all over the city. Limiting the colors to two or three and highlighting the play’s title that surrounded the tap artist in a fresh jazzed up style really made the design eye catching. The aim was to appeal to a wide range of people from the city and outer borders, the campaign has now become a seasonal tradition in the city.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“If you look through design history and you see something that looks really radical, that’s what you’re going to be doing now. If you think that’s nice, that’s what you’ve already been doing. If you think it’s tired, that’s what you were doing five years ago. But if you think it’s ugly, that’s what you’re going to be doing in five years.”</em> ― Paula Scher </p>

<h3>Maps</h3>
<p>In the 1990s, Paula Scher began painting bold, colorful maps of the world, using her new typographic style.  Displaying it continents, countries, islands, oceans and cities, she painted the world as she sees it.   The larger her canvases became, the more detailed her geographical visions became, displaying the very streets and neighborhoods we live in.  With a revelating display of image and type, these creations reached as big as twelve feet in size.  These images where swirling in torrents of information and clever commentary related to the location. </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">#<p class="conclusion"><span class="leader">CONCLUSION</span></h2>  

<p>It can be difficult to fathom the creative mind of another, or to isolate that unique spark of creative genius.  It is something that takes more than conventional thought, it derives from our emotions, intellect and even our moral characteristics, all we can do as a designer is show the world how we see it.</p>

<p>Whilst researching Paula Scher's life and career, I found it particularly fascinating how her love for pop culture and fine art coincide in her work making it diverse and relatable, as well as bold and expressive. Establishing herself as a graphic designer, illustrator, painter, author, art educator, and speaker for over 40 years Paula has certainly became an Icon to myself and my generation.  Its intriguing how her life in the city has influenced her career and brand as a designer.  I found this is shown specifically through the Maps and Transit Projects.  Her creativeness and ability to always pushed through boundaries is inspiring.  Her work is relatable and welcoming to everyone and this I believe is why she has vastly became an Iconic figure within the graphic design industry, greatly influencing Design Culture as we know it.</p>
